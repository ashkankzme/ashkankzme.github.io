Prior to grad school, I was a Technical Team Leader (among other previous technical roles) at [TAPSI](https://tapsi.ir/), a ride-sharing company in Iran. I worked in multiple data-driven product teams, most importantly in pricing, dispatch and data infrastructure. At TAPSI I worked on a broad range of research areas such as computational economics, supply/demand prediction, taxi dispatch algorithms and time-series analysis. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from University of Tehran.
