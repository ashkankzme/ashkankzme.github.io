I'm Ashkan Kazemi, a research scientist at [**Meedan**](https://meedan.com) where we develop artificial intelligence tools to address information integrity challenges of a global internet. My research interests are in **natural language processing**, **computational social science**, and broadly **AI** and **complexity science**. 

I completed my PhD at the **University of Michigan**, Ann Arbor working with [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) and [Verónica Pérez-Rosas](https://vrncapr.engin.umich.edu/) at the [Language and Information Technologies (LIT)](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) and [Michigan Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.engin.umich.edu/) labs in the department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/). My PhD dissertation focused on [**Human-Centered Natural Language Processing for Countering Misinformation**](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/193271). For a full list of publications please visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vq4f4C8AAAAJ&hl=en) page.

Prior to grad school, I was a Technical Team Leader (among other technical roles) at [TAPSI](https://tapsi.ir/), a ride-sharing company in Iran where I worked on a broad range of applied research questions in the intersection of machine learning and computational economics, namely supply/demand prediction, surge pricing, taxi dispatch algorithms and time-series analysis. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer/Software Engineering from [**University of Tehran**](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en).
