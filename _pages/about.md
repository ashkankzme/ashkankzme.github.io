I'm Ashkan Kazemi, a 4th year PhD candidate at the **University of Michigan**, Ann Arbor. My advisor is [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) and I'm part of the [Language and Information Technologies (LIT) lab](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) in the department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/).

My research interests are in **natural language processing** and **computational social science**. My PhD work mainly focuses on using NLP to understand and fight misinformation on the internet. Our paper on [matching similar claims in high and low resource languages for scaling fact-checking globally](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.347/) was published in the ACL 2021 conference as a long paper. A [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04726) of our study on *tiplines* as an opt-in content discovery tool to help moderate end-to-end encrypted social media like WhatsApp while respecting user privacy. For a full list of my publications please visit [my Google Scholar account](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vq4f4C8AAAAJ&hl=en).

I started my PhD in the Fall of 2018. Prior to that, I was a Technical Team Leader (among other previous roles) at [TAPSI](https://tapsi.ir/), a ride-sharing company in Iran. I worked in multiple data-driven product teams, most importantly in pricing, dispatch and data infrastructure. At TAPSI I worked on a broad range of research areas such as computational economics, supply/demand prediction, taxi dispatch algorithms and time-series analysis. The algorithms I worked on fascilitate a few million ridesharing transactions in Iran everyday. Before working at TAPSI, I used to work as a part-time software engineer at the Institute for Applied Intelligent Systems at University of Tehran, where I wrote a lot of back-end Java code. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from University of Tehran by Summer of 2017, after taking a gap semester.

In my free time I enjoy walks in nature and museums, watch films and documentaries and travel to new places. One of my PhD goals is to eat at every restaurant in Ann Arbor before I graduate and so far I've covered more than half. 

If I can help you with anything including graduate school applications and research questions, feel free to drop me an email.
