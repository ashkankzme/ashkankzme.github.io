I'm Ashkan Kazemi, a PhD candidate at **University of Michigan**, Ann Arbor. I work with and learn from [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) and I'm part of the [LIT lab](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) in the department of Computer Science and Engineering.

My research interests are in **natural language processing** and its **applications in** studying and improving **(social) media**, **and** more broadly **computational social sciences**. My research (so far) has been focused on development of **NLP methods for** studying **misinformation** and **fact-checking**.

I started my PhD in the Fall of 2018. Prior to that, I was a Technical Team Leader (among other previous roles) at [TAPSI](https://tapsi.ir/), a ride-sharing company in Iran. I led and worked in multiple data-driven product teams, most importantly in pricing, dispatch and data infrastructure. The problems at I worked on at TAPSI were on a range of topics including computational economics, supply/demand prediction, taxi dispatch algorithms and time-series analysis. Our pricing algorithms are impacting a few million drivers and passengers in Iran!

Before working at TAPSI, I used to work part-time as a software engineer at the Institute for Applied Intelligent Systems at University of Tehran, where I wrote a lot of back-end Java code. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from University of Tehran in Summer 2017, after taking a gap semester.

In my free time, I watch films and documentaries and travel to new places. One of my PhD goals is to eat at every restaurant in Ann Arbor before I graduate and so far I've covered more than half (I'm hoping COVID-19 doesn't slow this down much). 

If you think I can help you with anything including graduate school applications and research questions, feel free to drop me an email.
