I'm Ashkan Kazemi, a final year PhD candidate at the **University of Michigan**, Ann Arbor. My advisors are [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) and [Verónica Pérez-Rosas](https://vrncapr.engin.umich.edu/) and I am member of the [Language and Information Technologies (LIT)](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) and [Michigan Artificial Intelligence](https://ai.engin.umich.edu/) labs in the department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/).

My research interests are in **natural language processing**, **computational social science**, and **complexity**. My PhD dissertation focuses on using NLP to understand and limit misinformation on the internet. For a full list of publications please visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vq4f4C8AAAAJ&hl=en) page.

Prior to grad school, I was a Technical Team Leader (among other technical roles) at [TAPSI](https://tapsi.ir/), a ride-sharing company in Iran. I worked in multiple data-driven product teams, most importantly in pricing, dispatch and data infrastructure. At TAPSI I worked on a broad range of applied research questions in computational economics, namely supply/demand prediction, surge pricing, taxi dispatch algorithms and time-series analysis. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer/Software Engineering from University of Tehran.

_I'm happy to chat about research (both my own papers and broader research in natural language processing, computational social, and misinformation.) and graduate school, as well as other topics you think I can help with. Feel free to drop me an email._
