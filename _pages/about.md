I'm Ashkan Kazemi, a final year PhD candidate at the **University of Michigan**, Ann Arbor. My advisors are [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) and [Verónica Pérez-Rosas](https://vrncapr.engin.umich.edu/) and I'm part of the [Language and Information Technologies (LIT) lab](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) in the department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/).

**I'm on the industry job market this year!** I'm looking for **Research Scientist/Engineer**, **Machine Learning Engineer**, and **Software Engineer** roles in NLP and machine learning. Feel free to reach out if you are hiring!

My research interests are in **natural language processing** and **computational social science**. My PhD work mainly focuses on using NLP to understand and counter misinformation on the internet. Our paper on [matching similar claims in high and low resource languages for scaling fact-checking globally](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.347/) was published in the ACL 2021 conference as a long paper. Our new [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04726) of a study on *tiplines* as an opt-in content discovery tool provides support that the approach can help moderate end-to-end encrypted social media like WhatsApp while respecting user privacy. For a full list of my publications please visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vq4f4C8AAAAJ&hl=en) page.

Prior to grad school, I was a Technical Team Leader (among other previous technical roles) at [TAPSI](https://tapsi.ir/), a ride-sharing company in Iran. I worked in multiple data-driven product teams, most importantly in pricing, dispatch and data infrastructure. At TAPSI I worked on a broad range of research areas such as computational economics, supply/demand prediction, taxi dispatch algorithms and time-series analysis. The algorithms I worked on fascilitate a few million ridesharing transactions in Iran everyday. Before working at TAPSI, I used to work as a part-time software engineer at the Institute for Applied Intelligent Systems at University of Tehran, where I wrote a lot of back-end Java code. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from University of Tehran by Summer of 2017, after taking a gap semester.

If I can help you with anything including graduate school applications and research questions, feel free to drop me an email.
