I'm Ashkan (sometimes Ash) Kazemi, a PhD student at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My adviser is [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) and I'm part of the [LIT lab](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) in the department of Computer Science and Engineering. 

I want to study the different ways we can use AI and natural language processing to improve news and journalism in general. For the most part of my PhD so far, I've studied methods to automatically detect misinformation in news and social media. I'm also broadly interested in social computing and applications of NLP in computational social science.

I started my PhD in the Fall of 2018. Before that, I was a Technical Team Leader at [TAPSI](https://tapsi.ir/), a ride-sharing company in Iran. I lead and worked in multiple data-driven product teams, most importantly in pricing, dispatch and data infrastructure. I did a lot of computational economics, supply/demand prediction, car dispatch algorithms and general machine learning and time-series analysis in my 26 months at TAPSI. Our pricing algorithms are impacting a few million drivers and passengers in Iran!

Before working at TAPSI, I used to work part-time as a software engineer at the Institute for Applied Intelligent Systems at University of Tehran, where I wrote a lot of back-end Java code. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from University of Tehran.
