I'm Ashkan Kazemi, a final year PhD candidate at the **University of Michigan**, Ann Arbor. My advisors are [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) and [Verónica Pérez-Rosas](https://vrncapr.engin.umich.edu/) and I'm part of the [Language and Information Technologies (LIT) lab](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) in the department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/).

My research interests are in **natural language processing** and **computational social science**. My PhD work mainly focuses on using NLP to understand and counter misinformation on the internet. For a full list of my publications please visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vq4f4C8AAAAJ&hl=en) page.

Prior to grad school, I was a Technical Team Leader (among other previous technical roles) at [TAPSI](https://tapsi.ir/), a ride-sharing company in Iran. I worked in multiple data-driven product teams, most importantly in pricing, dispatch and data infrastructure. At TAPSI I worked on a broad range of research areas such as computational economics, supply/demand prediction, taxi dispatch algorithms and time-series analysis. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from University of Tehran by Summer of 2017, after taking a gap semester.
