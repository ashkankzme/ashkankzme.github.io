I'm Ashkan (sometimes Ash) Kazemi, a PhD student at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My advisor is [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/) and I'm part of the [LIT lab](https://lit.eecs.umich.edu/) in the department of Computer Science and Engineering. 

I want to study the different ways we can use AI and natural language processing to improve news and journalism. So far in my PhD I've studied methods to automatically detect misinformation in news and social media. I'm also broadly interested in social computing and applications of NLP in computational social science.

I started my PhD in the Fall of 2018. Before that, I was a Technical Team Leader at [TAPSI](https://tapsi.ir/), a ride-sharing company in Iran. I lead and worked in multiple data-driven product teams, most importantly in pricing, dispatch and data infrastructure. I did a lot of computational economics, supply/demand prediction, taxi dispatch algorithms and general machine learning and time-series analysis in my 26 months at TAPSI. Our pricing algorithms are impacting a few million drivers and passengers in Iran!

Before working at TAPSI, I used to work part-time as a software engineer at the Institute for Applied Intelligent Systems at University of Tehran, where I wrote a lot of back-end Java code. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering from University of Tehran.

I have watched many films and am known for my film recommendations. Lately I ran out of films and started watching documentaries. In my free time, I travel to new places to meet new people and try new foods. One of my PhD goals is to eat at every restaurant in Ann Arbor before I graduate and so far I've covered more than half. 

Drop me an email with any questions or requests that I can help with (about grad school applications, research questions or really anything else).
